# Into TW.

Thanks for taking the time to have a conversation with us.

This is a take-home technical test designed to be fun and allow you to show a little creativity.

It is based on real code that we have implemented more than once.

There are three files:

1. [operativ.kafka.topic.clj](src/operativ/kafka/topic.clj) contains two functions that we would like you to implement
2. [operativ.kafka.topic-test](test/operativ/kafka/topic-test.clj)  contains three tests that currently fail
3. [operativ.test.data](test/operativ/test/data.clj) contains the test data and description of what it all means

There are is one principal technical challenge:

1. Implement the operativ.kafka.topic/sizes function, causing the first test to pass.

THere is an extension technical challenge:

2. Implement the remaining functions, causing all the tests to pass.

Once you are ready, reply to the email you received and come to our offices for a chat about your solution.
